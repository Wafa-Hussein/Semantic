                <p>Sen said he hopes to seek FDA approval for the chip within a year. 
                    Once it receives FDA approval, the device could be used for clinical 
                    research in people, including patients in hospitals, health centers 
                    and emergency rooms, as well as in other emergency situations by first 
                    responders or the military.</p>
